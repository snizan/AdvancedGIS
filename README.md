# About Me
I am a Pittsburgh transplant originally from the greater Tampa, FL area. I received my B.A. in Policy Studies and Economics from Chatham University and am currently a second-year Master's of Science in Public Policy and Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. During my undergraduate years, I worked at the YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh and the Pennsylvania Center for Women and Politics in program management and research. After graduating, I was a campaign professional, working on multiple state and local level races doing everything from field management, budget development, and creating campaign strategy. In early 2020, I transitioned into campaign consulting where I work on marketing, research, copywriting, and design while I complete my Master's.

In my free time, I knit, watch the Tampa Bay Lightning, and cuddle with my cat, Andrei Vasilevskitty "Kassie."


# What I hope to learn
I'm hoping to learn several things including strategies on making political borders during reapportionment years after the decennial census, and making low-cost or free customaizable and interative maps for organizations.
