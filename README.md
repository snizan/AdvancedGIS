# About Me
I am a Pittsburgh transplant originally from the greater Tampa, FL area. I received my B.A. in Policy Studies and Economics from Chatham University and am currently a second-year Master's of Science in Public Policy and Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. During my undergraduate years, I worked at the YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh and the Pennsylvania Center for Women and Politics in program management and research. After graduating, I was a campaign professional, working on multiple state and local level races doing everything from field management, budget development, and creating campaign strategy. In early 2020, I transitioned into campaign consulting where I work on marketing, research, copywriting, and design while I complete my Master's.

In my free time, I knit, watch the Tampa Bay Lightning, and cuddle with my cat, Andrei Vasilevskitty "Kassie."


# What I hope to learn
I'm hoping to learn how to draw borders for political maps, especially after the decennial census. Additionally, I am interested in manipulating political district maps to find patterns in voter turnout based on demographics and geography, and creating free, interactive, and custom maps. Not only will these skills allow me to better serve my clients, they are useful and transferrable skills.
